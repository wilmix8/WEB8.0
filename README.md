#  WEB8.0(OJ7)
===================

 WEB8.0(OJ7) is   invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2013 in  java  and modified  in  DOTWEB3.0 P.L in year  2016.And now at year 2025, it's Further modified  at  CH$ P.L instead of java. OakJava7 is  renamed as  WEB8.0(OJ7) programming Langauge.


 Note: 
 ====
 The  Meaning  of   WEB8.0(OJ7)    is  Olive tree +  Jemin  Advanced Virtual Machine  O  gives   the  meaning a symbol of friendship and reconciliation, cleansing and healing, light, victory and richness and, above all, a sign of peace.

History about creation of  WEB8.0(OJ7)  Compiler
===========================================

How  WEB8.0(OJ7)  is invented?
=========================

 WEB8.0(OJ7)  is invented by Wilmix Jemin J by Dotweb3.0 Programming language in
Dotweb3.0 and java.But now the Java Implementation is changed to CH$ P.L.
Because there is no code security in Java/J2ee when i create the  WEB8.0(OJ7)  compiler.
So the  WEB8.0(OJ7)  implementation is changed to CH$ P.L.
We know the fact  Dotweb3.0 is invented in CH$ and
CH$ is invented in GDollar P.L.

Evidence for creation of  WEB8.0(OJ7)  compiler
==========================================

Dotweb3.0 is more advanced than any existing
programming language in today's IT world.

 How i write Dotweb program to create  WEB8.0(OJ7)  compiler is given below...?
 ==========================================================================

web8c.web7
==============

<DOTWEB3>
	
<PACK> Javac7

{

<CLASS> Web8c
  {
          public void main()

        {
 <TRY>

      {

//wilmix code

//Console Design

//If no input it will list how to use  WEB8.0(OJ7)  compiler.

 if (args.Length <= 0)
      {

        <PRINTLN>("============================================================================");
         <PRINTLN>(" WEB8.0(OJ7)  @JeminInformationTechnology (C)  2025  All Rights  Reserved ");
         <PRINTLN>("============================================================================");
         <PRINTLN>("To  compile   WEB8.0(OJ7)  files use  => web8c  <filename.web8> ");
         
           <PRINTLN>("To  compile and   create  a  prototype software use  => web8c <filename.web>");
           <PRINTLN>("To  compile and   create a  DataScience and MachineLearning application use  \n" +
                "=> web8c <filename.oj7ua>");
            
           <PRINTLN>("============================================================================");
      }
      else
//wilmix code

{

// Calling  WEB8.0(OJ7)  compiler libraries.


web8c.web8c.Web8Main(args);

}

}
      }

      <CATCH> (Exception e)

      {
        // print the  errors

        <PRINTLN>(" WEB8.0(OJ7)   Error.... "+e);

      }  
    }
        }

    }



Other Evidence about  WEB8.0(OJ7) 
================================


 WEB8.0(OJ7)  will work without the installation Java Jdk compiler.
That we can see the Screen shot. WEB8.0(OJ7)  borrows CJava runtime 
from Gdollar P.L.I will change it later when i release the 
 WEB8.0(OJ7)  P.L.Also you can see  web8c.exe , and Web8 
entirely different and run without installation of Java compiler 
JDK.You can see the ScreenShot for your Reference which given below..


ScreenShot about  WEB8.0(OJ7)  Evidence
-----------------------------------
This  screen shot will be changed  due to
OakJava7 is  renamed  to  Web8.0(OJ7)


Note:
====

Why we don't publish WEB8.0(OJ7) all the  code ?
===========================================

Because if the full implementation of WEB8.0(OJ7) is known to others,so hackers,etc can easily create the compiler
in Dotweb3.0 and they may overtake WEB8.0(OJ7) easily.
Because using Dotweb3.0 P.L one can create the compiler as fast as could.That's why we don't release  Dotweb3.0

The Major common syntax  for  oakjava7 is given below..

Explanation:

=============

 

All  WEB8.0(OJ7)   should   start   with   class web8Prog
{ 

 and it should include  the  constructor of WEB8.0(OJ7) program..

 public web8Prog()
	{
		super();

	}



But   public void  main() is   used  in WEB8.0(OJ7) program

 

 public void main() is for protection  from hackers.

DEMERITS  of JAVA and  C#

==========================

 

a) JAVA  class  file   has  many demerits  so  any thing  you create  a compiler  in  java

the source  code  can  be  easily  taken  by JAD.

 

b)  C#  (.exe  or  .dll)  source code can  also  be  taken  using  code  reflector.

so   C#  also   fails  in  Code   security.

That's  why  WEB8.0(OJ7)  came to the picture.

 

WEB8.0(OJ7) is also used  for creating  datastructures 

and    compilers. ie) It is  also used in Research side.

 

 

WEB8.0(OJ7)  accepts  ".web"   filename  and  translate  to  .jclass file.

 

that  java  is  said  to  WEB8.0(OJ7)  different  from  orginal java.

 

which  is   not understood  by hackers.

 

 

WEB8.0(OJ7)  loads    .dll in   memory  to create  a  Prototype  software.

 

c) web8  <filename.web8> and  => will  also   create  .exe , .ojava7 prototype software


which  jdk1.8  or any  java compiler  cannot  do it.

It  also  supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it  is Learnable . 

Note : [ World Rank A'  means  Advanced  programming language  when  compare  to  all  the  Programming languages  and   10  times  greater  than   Web1.0 programming  language.]

Top quality software according to wilmixsolomonresearch lab.

i) WEB8.0(OJ7) is used with JDollar,CWEB section, C#, and with all writ Programming languages.

j)  WEB8.0(OJ7)  also  provide   Shortest  function Statements  ...

k)  WEB8.0(OJ7)  is  easy   to  learn  and  focus  . ie) it  is  Learnable  Programming Language...

l)  WEB8.0(OJ7)   also  had  his   own  shell  prompt  known  as  Web8Shell...

you  can  execute and  run  Java7.0 Programs...

m)  WEB8.0(OJ7)  also   focus  on Code  Security.

n)  Web8  is  an interactive  Programming Language..

ie)  It  is  used   with  Java  ,  C#  And  other  writ  Programming Languages .. 

Java  and C#  professionals can  easily  focus. 

o)  WEB8.0(OJ7)  is  focused on MachineLearning,Datascience  ,etc.

p)  WEB8.0(OJ7)  is  used  with  WNOSQL  Database which  provides  high   security...

q)  WEB8.0(OJ7)  is used  with  WXML  which  is  very  easy   to  create   Forms ,Reports,etc.It avoids

typing  html  everytime.  

r) WEB8.0(OJ7)  also   supports   100%  OOPS  concept. So  it  is called as  a  Pure OOPS  Programming Language.

s)  We  can   convert   Java program  to  WEB8.0(OJ7)  Program  by   using  command  ConvertToWeb8.

t)  WEB8.0(OJ7)   Intermediate Program    is  used   to  test  the  WEB8.0(OJ7)  Program  , when  user

done  mistake  in WEB8.0(OJ7) Programming. 

u) WEB8.0(OJ7)    is  designed   in such  a  way   that  Java  Programmers  can   easily   follow it.

w) WEB8.0(OJ7)   will  work  in  Linux  platform like  ubuntu, etc. So write once  and  run any where.

x)  ScrollServer  can  be used  with  Java Frameworks like  Hibernate,  Mybatics, Java Spring,EJB.
We can use this for constructing web application. but WEB8.0(OJ7) cannot be used with
java Frameworks  like  Hibernate,  Mybatics, Java Spring,EJB. Because WEB8.0(OJ7) and java/j2ee
are invented in different programming Languages.
eg) WEB8.0(OJ7) is implemented by Wilmix Jemin j in DOTWEB P.L and Jdk1.6. But 
Java/J2ee  is  implemented by James Gosling in Oak P.L.
Dotweb P.L is used for compiler construction.

so  we   can  call  WEB8.0(OJ7)  as an  interactive  programming Language
when we used with scrollserver.

y) WEB8.0(OJ7)  is  Good  for  the  Interviewer  to  select  a  rightful candidate.

Z)  To Write  WEB8.0(OJ7)  program for  any task it will take  only few  minutes  or

if  it is  a miniproject  we  can  finish  the  mini project  with in 1 hour.

Thus  WEB8.0(OJ7)  Programming Language is very  easy, it  saves  time and  cost. So it  is a user friendly  Programming Language.

AA)  WEB8.0(OJ7)  Programming Language also compile and  run  the  file  like .web

and .web8   at the same time  using   webp7.exe. 
 

 

 

 

Note: Here only  WEB8.0(OJ7) Programming language is  focused.

====================================================

EXPLANATION
============


Here when you code the Machine Learning program  using this syntax and compile it using web8c <filename.oj7ua> , 

it will automatically convert to  WEB8.0(OJ7) program ie(.web) . And you will get a optimized WEB8.0(OJ7) code and .exe   and .ojava7 files.

You can also test the  WEB8.0(OJ7) Machine Learning program using generated (.web) code...So when we notice that here <OJ7ML>  act like a WEB8.0(OJ7) user friendly framework. It act like a XML syntax with data present inside it.

This  WEB8.0(OJ7)  Machine Learning program (<OJ7ML) will automatically generate (.web). This (<OJ7ML>) 

program has attractive syntax.So it is considered as a WEB8.0(OJ7) advanced framework or 

WEB8.0(OJ7) Machine learning framework. It reduces the pain of writing program for (.web).

And It saves time and  cost.The Full form of <OJ7ML> syntax is "WEB8-MACHINELEARNING". 

It is used for Dynamic Webpages construction ie) DB with GUI + Business Logic and WEB8.0(OJ7) Servlet.

We can also generate .dll  using this syntax by using .dll value as a Type.

So when you include .exe value as a Type means when you compile the WEB8.0(OJ7)

it will generate the  .exe files and  .ojava7 files.

This document is under construction to change all the names due to hackers /other institute / Companies oppose Oakjava7 and to destroy oakjava7 ,so this name is changed. Because they want to implement oakjava7 features in their technology and to gain the profit. THis copying features is violating according to SIT rules. Everything is implemented but document preparation is changed due to hackers.
